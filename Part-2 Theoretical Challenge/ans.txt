Theoretical Challenge
====================

Ans-1 =>

1. First, I will insert all data with comma seperated and then save it with the .csv extension

2. Then I will read the data using BufferReader and Then I will convert the data to an array.

String file = "src\\file.csv"
BufferedReader bufferReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));

3. Then I will store the data in Key-Value format using HashMap


4. While splitting values if (=) is founded, I will consider them as a formula and then pass them as a parameter in my method to solve them.

5. In last, I will return the Map with all values.



Ans-2 =>

 1. If the wrong file path is provided inside the FileReader, then we will get fileNotFoundException

 2. Circular dependency error, there might be a chance that circular dependency may occur, as if formula A is dependent on C and C is dependent of A


Ans-3 =>

If the wrong path is provided then our code will break.

Q what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?


Ans =>


1. Data Validation => Validate the data

2. Authentication => check the user credentials, using Spring Security, JAAS API

3. Authorization => Check whether the authenticated user has the authority to access the API, using Spring security (session-based or JWT Token based)

4. Exception Handling => Handle exceptions properly, like server errors, invalid input, etc.
